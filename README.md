# todo-list
An Odin Assignment

## Overview

This is a ToDo List webapp made using concepts learned in The Odin Project. You can make new todos, add priority, and add todos to a group or Project to keep like items together.   

## Concepts Learned

In the making of this assignment I got a better grasp on how to use and implement libraries and the use of webpack. I also learned ways to organize code with modules.  

I learned about media queries in CSS to add mobile support along with better ways to make different elements and items scale with screen size. I also created a sidebar that will slide on and off the screen when the button is pressed, along with one way of creating dropdown boxes. As well as a basic understanding of the built in Web Storage API.

## Features

- Local Storage
- Mobile Support
- Creation of Todo items with projects to group them together
- Deletion of Todo items and projects
- Dropdowns to hide/show Projects or individual Todos
